    <h2>Super Secret Descriptions of the Machine Learning Involved </h2>
    <p class = "pass">The data used for the Airbnb Price Prediction Software is divided into two Excel files: a training file and a testing file. 
      Both files contain real-world data across multiple columns that detail various aspects of an Airbnb listing. 
      Notably, the testing file does not include the target column, 'log_price'. These columns cover a range of information including identification 
      pricing data (ID and 'log_price', the latter of which is converted back to regular price for final predictions), specifics of the property such
      as property type and room type, geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and physical attributes like the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
      They also include booking and host information, such as whether the host has a profile picture ('host_has_profile_pic'), whether their identity is verified ('host_identity_verified'), 
      and their response rates. Other attributes like amenities, descriptions, neighborhood details, and thumbnail URLs are also part of the data. Due to the complexity and varied relevance of these features, 
      only selected onesâ€”such as 'log_price' (excluded during testing), property type, room type, number of people the property accommodates, 
      number of bathrooms, bed type, cancellation policy, city, host information, latitude, longitude, number of reviews, bedrooms, 
      and number of beds are used for training. Techniques such as one-hot encoding and strategies to manage missing values are employed to facilitate effective training and comparison of these attributes. 
      Our model had a final R^2 value of 0.614 and can effectively predict prices within $30 of the original price. The predicted prices from the test set can be viewed as a csv file,
      along with several images from data analysis and the training/testing process. Our model consisted of a stacked regressor design, consisting of LightGBM and Ridge Regression to predict the prices.</p>

      <p class = "pass">In order to plan our vacations far into the future, we have also created a weather predictor, so that you can know exactly how to prepare for your trip.
       Although our site is mainly used to predict weather for vacation spots, it can be used anywhere in the US for any purpose: daily life, event planning, etc. 
       It is important to remember that this is just a predictor, that is based on historical data. Unlike weather channels we do not have satellites providing us live weather data,
        so if you are using this far into the future or are trying to predict far into the future, our model may not be accurate.</p>
